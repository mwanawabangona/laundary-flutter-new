As we process a high volume we might not always be able to cater to personal requirements (e.g. temperature, washing powders, etc.). Please note that the items are not ironed.</li></ul></li><li><strong>8.4.3&nbsp;</strong>Colour Separation<ul><li>We will separate the clothes into lights and darks for you. Although we will take the utmost care in doing this, we will accept no responsibility if there is any bleeding or colour transfer during the cleaning process.</li></ul></li><li><strong>8.4.4&nbsp;</strong>Size of Bag<ul><li>We will measure the laundry by weight. The minimum weight is 6kg. We will update this after we have weighed it at the facility. Any orders below 6kg will be charged at the Wash, Tumble Dry &amp; Fold price.</li></ul></li><li><strong>8.4.5&nbsp;</strong>Damaged Items<ul><li>We will not be liable for damage to items, as we wash by the load and do not inspect the care labels of each garment. For garments that need to be specially treated i.e. leather, silk, cashmere, fur, velvet and other delicate garments, please ensure that these items can be machine washed and tumble-dried.</li></ul></li><li><strong>8.4.6&nbsp;</strong>Tagging<ul><li>Laundry items are tagged by the load and not individually tagged.

Nothing in these Terms will affect these legal rights.</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>10. Price and payment</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>10.1&nbsp;</strong>The price of the Services will be set out in Our price list as set out in the App or at www.goldstardrycleaners.com/prices and will be the price in force at the time you place your Order.

You will be notified of any applicable Service Fee and taxes prior to purchase on the checkout page on our Application.</li><li><strong>10.3&nbsp;</strong>Our prices may include VAT, depending on the legislation where the order is served. However, if the rate of tax changes between the date we accept your Order and the date of payment, We will have to adjust the rate of VAT that you pay.</li><li><strong>10.4&nbsp;</strong>Upon placing an Order we capture the payment but do not directly charge your card, although some banks will show it as a recent transaction. We process payments when we have received your Order at the facility and after cleaning. If your final total is greater than your captured total (i.e. we need to update your Order accordingly) it may show on your recent transactions, but the captured amount will be released when we have taken the full payment. We will take payment from a debit or credit card, the details of which were supplied with your Order. If for any reason we are unable to take payment, you will become liable to Us for the sum due plus interest at the rate of 3% a year above the base lending rate of Barclays Bank PLC from the time to time. Interest will accrue on a daily basis from due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. You must pay Us interest together with any overdue amount.</li></ul><h4><strong>11. Our liability to you</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>11.1&nbsp;</strong>In the unlikely event of loss or damage to an item, Gold Star Dry Cleaners will pay compensation in line with the Fair Compensation Guidelines as provided by the Textile Services Association.
